# lecaa
Check for Let's Encrypt CAA issue

usage
-----

Prepare list of serials:

    ./prepare-lecaa

(This will download a list of affected certificates and extract the
serial numbers.)

Run:

    ./lecaa [host]

It will output affected hosts and be silent for unaffected hosts.

This can be used in combination with GNU parallel to check a large
number of hosts:

    parallel -a [list_of_hosts] -j 30 --timeout 10 ./lecaa

background
----------

Let's Encrypt announced a bug in their system's CAA checks, which forced
them to revoke 3 million certificates on very short notice.

This script allows you to efficiently check affected hosts.
